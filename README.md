# How to Play Piano
## Introduction

Learning to play the piano without any formal instruction can seem like a daunting challenge. However, with time and practice, it can turn into a fun and full-filling past time that encourages creativity and personal growth. The piano provides an outlet for emotional expression while also stimulating cognitive development and building fine motor skills. Let's begin!
### WARNING: Time and Dedication required!

## Steps

1. Familarize youself with the Keyboard Layout
- There are a total of 88 keys (black and white)
- White keys represent natural notes while black keys represent sharps and flats
- Start by identifying the pattern of the keys to learn the notes(C-F)


2. Learn Proper Hand Position
- Curl your fingers above the piano like you are holding a tennis ball in your palm (arched fingers)
- Your right thumb starts at middle C
- Become comfortable finding middle C aquickly and recognizing the adjacent notes

3. Understand basic Music Notation
- The staff consists of 5 lines and 4 spaces, sequentially indicating a different note from A-G
- Learn the notation for Treble (right) and Bass (left) Clef
- Learn the symbols for sharps and flats
- Continue practicing until you are able to easily correlate a written note on a score to the appropiate key on the piano

4. Learn and Practice Basic Scales
- Scales are musical patterns based on corresponding sounds in certain "keys" (Major or Minor)
- Start with the C Major Scale: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
- Play slowly and focus on sound, clarity and rhythm
- Practice on both hands individually before using both to build coordination and finger strength
- Progress to more complicated major scale and then minor scales

5.Play Simple Songs using One Hand
- Simple songs such as "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" or "Hot Cross Buns" can be played on one hand 
- Get access to the scores (sheet music) online and begin practicing
- Focus on rhythm and clarity

6. Practice Basic Chords
-Chords are simultaneous notes played with a single hand that are essential for creating harmony
-Start with basic chords like C Major, G Major or F Major
-Focus on transistioning between different chords smoothly with both hands

7. Improving Rhythm and Timing
-Rhythm is essential to muscial performance
-Practicing with a metronome to keep time can help you develop your internal clock
-Practice playing the same simple song at different tempos

8. Developing Dynamics and Musical Expression
- Playing dynamics involves the volume and intonation of a particular note or phrase in different ways
- Forte (Loud) and Pianissimo (soft)
- Legato/slurring (smooth, connected) or staccato (short, light)
- Try altering the style of a simple song and experiment at adding musicality based on your personal interpretation

9. Practice and Patience
-Consistency is critical
-Setting aside short practice sessions (30 m - 1 h) daily can help with retention and growth
-Progressively increase the complexity of the pieces you play
-Choose from a diverse range of genres and styles
